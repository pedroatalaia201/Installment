# Installment
> A simple exercise to pratice interfaces and lists, using only C#.

At first I was doing this on Fiddle(https://dotnetfiddle.net/),
Then I ended up doing it on Visual Studio.
In this exercise you can add clients and installments that they have to pay.

## Add a new costumer

* Firts type "1" to add a new costumer.
* Then you will need to write the nema of this new costumer.
* There'll be a option if in the register of ths costumer you want add a installment already.<br>
    - In the example bellow I type y(yes).<br>
    - But if you don't wanna do that yet, just type n(no), and will appear the message that the register was done and the program will show you the id of the costumer.
* Then you'll need to inform the data of this installment on thist format dd/mm/yyyy.
* Next you need to inform the value of the installment.
* With all this done the program will show you a message that the register was concluded, and will show the id of the costumer(make sue o note the id and the name).
